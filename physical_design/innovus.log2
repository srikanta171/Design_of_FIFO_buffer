MultiBuffering failure reasons
------------------------------------------------
*info:    11 net(s): Could not be fixed because it is multi driver net.
*info:    13 net(s): Could not be fixed as the net is considered as IPO ignored by the process.

*info:    11 net(s): Could not be fixed because it is multi driver net.
*info:    13 net(s): Could not be fixed as the net is considered as IPO ignored by the process.

Resizing failure reasons

**WARN: (TA-146):	A combinational timing loop(s) was found in the design. You can find detailed information about all timing loops in the file './CTE_loops.rpt'. You should examine loop break points chosen automatically by the tool to ensure they are the most appropriate break locations. It is further recommended that validated loop break points be added to the constraint set via set_disable_timing to ensure consistent handling during the design flow.
